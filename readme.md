### Big-O Notation
#### Definition:
A theoretical measure of the execution of an algorithm, usually the time or memory needed, given the problem size n, which is usually the number of items. Informally, saying some equation f(n) = O(g(n)) means it is less than some constant multiple of g(n). The notation is read, "f of n is big oh of g of n".
#### Formal Definition:
f(n) = O(g(n)) means there are positive constants c and k, such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ k. The values of c and k must be fixed for the function f and must not depend on n.

### Stability
#### Definition:
A sorting algorithm is said to be **stable** if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.
