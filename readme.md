## 0. Background
#### 1) Big-O Notation
**Definition**: A theoretical measure of the execution of an algorithm, usually the time or memory needed, given the problem size n, which is usually the number of items. Informally, saying some equation f(n) = O(g(n)) means it is less than some constant multiple of g(n). The notation is read, "f of n is big oh of g of n".  
**Formal Definition**: f(n) = O(g(n)) means there are positive constants c and k, such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ k. The values of c and k must be fixed for the function f and must not depend on n.

#### 2) Stability
**Definition**: A sorting algorithm is said to be **stable** if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.

## 1. Bubble Sort
## 2. Insertion Sort
## 3. Quick Sort
* Alogrithm
  1. Select a random number from the whole array, we call it "pivot".
  2. Place the number smaller than pivot to the left side of the array. 
  3. Place the number bigger than the pivot to the right side of the array.
  4. Apply the steps above recursively to the left and right side of the array.
## 4. Merge Sort
* Alogrithm
  1. Divide the array into two child arrays with same length.
  2. Apply the algorithm to the two child arrays.
  3. Merge two sorted child arrays into one final sorted array.
## 5. Heap Sort
